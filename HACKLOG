notes to myself.  It may contain the rationale for otherwise
undocumented design decisions, blind alleys, random ruminations, TODO
(and "to do later") items, and - from time to time - shopping lists.
Don't take it too seriously

This is the first version that is standalone from rticulate.  Noted so far

1) erector 0.8 doesn't seem to work on my machine: to_html instead of
returning a string of html returns what looks like the output of to_s
on an array of html fragment strings.

2) instead of having a public from_form method on every widget, should
we make it an argument to Widget::Form and spread the data around
using undocumented methods?  TBH Widget::Container is probably just as
good a place.  Perhaps we should pass :params to the constructor instead of
an argument to initialize, though,

I think Widget::Container might work well as an inline widget/wiget
that accepts a block for #new.  This would make it simpler to write
arbitrary containers.
